        <!-- <p>Include some detailed information about the dataset here. You should <a href="#">add a link</a> to the original dataset. You might also want to quote the license:</p> -->

             <p> This project is supposed to visualize certain relationships between airline data from the San Francisco International Airport           </p>
              <p>Data acquired from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Air-Traffic-Passenger-Statistics/rkru-6vcg">DataSF</a> on February 9, 2020.</p>

        <p>In addition to including a link to the source and license, you should describe the data. You might want a list of some sort to enumerate the different types of columns:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Passenger Count:</strong> This would be the total count of passengers that are going through SFO based on a certain time period.</li>

          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>

          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>

          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>

        <p> The data had to be sorted and fitlered out and I ended up doing it based on the time periods, I filtereted out uncommon and unecessary data. </p>

        <pre>
You can even put code into these pre blocks.
  It will preserve whitespace.
    That is helpful for formatted code.

        <p>You can alternatively embed a Gist if you want. There is an "embed" button on <a href="https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae">the Gist page</a> and results in something like this:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae.js"></script>
      </div>
      <!-- End page content -->

  <div id="footer">

  $(function(){
    $("#footer").load("footer.html");
