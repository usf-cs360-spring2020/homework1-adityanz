                  This is similar to the line graph, but rather than just looking at the past 10 years, I ended up looking at just the year of 2018, since 2019 did not have all the values in the current dataset. I had to do some data wrangling in Tableau where I had to restrict the dataset from only including values in 2018 and then converting the dates into months. The area chart has multiple boarding areas labeled with different colors, and the sizes between each area represent the number of people going through that specific area of the Airport. This was an interesting visualization since it showcases that a certain area of an airport is used a lot more than another, and since the airlines have the own zone, one can see that certain sectors have more load than another. One can conclude that during 2018, during the Summer that boarding area F has a lot more growth in terms of the area and amount than others, while area B is the most steady throughout.
