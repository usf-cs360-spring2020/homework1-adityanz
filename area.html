      </div>
                <p> This is simillar to the line graph, but rather than just looking at the past 10 years, I ended up looking at just the year of 2018, since 2019 did not have all the values in the current dataset.

                  I had to do some data wrangling in Tableu where I had to restrict the dataset from only including values on 2018 and then converting the dates into months.

                  The area chart has the multiple boarding areas labelled with different colors, and the sizes between the each area represent the number of people going through that specific area of the Airport.

                  This was an intersting visualziation, since it showcases that a certain area of an airport is used a lot more than another, and since the airlines have the own zone, one can see that certain sectors have more load than another.

                  One can conclude that during 2018, during the Summer that boarding area F has a lot more growth in terms of the area and amount than others, while area B is the most steady throughout.
